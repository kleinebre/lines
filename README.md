# Lines

A pretty line drawing in python opencv

Nothing much to see here.

To make this work on a linux box,

```
python3 -m virtualenv -p `which python3` venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that you should be able to run the script by running `lines.py`. Pressing a key closes the window.
